Dog Breed Classification using TensorFlow
This project is a deep learning solution to classify dog breeds using images from the Stanford Dogs Dataset. The model is built with TensorFlow and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the breed of a dog from a given image.

Features
Data Download: Automatically downloads the Stanford Dogs Dataset.
Model Building: Constructs a CNN model using TensorFlow.
Training and Evaluation: Trains the model on the dataset and evaluates its performance on a test set.
Dataset
The Stanford Dogs Dataset contains over 20,000 images of dogs from 120 different breeds. You can download the dataset from:

[Stanford Dogs Dataset Website](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)

Usage
The notebook will load the dataset, preprocess the images, build and train a TensorFlow CNN model.
It also checks for GPU availability to speed up training if possible.
Results
Once the model is trained, it will output predictions on test images and display the accuracy of the model. Visualizations of the predictions are also included.
